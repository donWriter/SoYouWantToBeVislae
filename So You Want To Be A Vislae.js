This is not about survival from starvation and dysentary. Vislae are very powerful. In other than the most extreme situations ideas like food and breathing just dont come into question in Satyrine. Certainly out in the wastelands its possible you'd worry about such thing but doing so has meaning - there's a message there about needs and wants, or seeing the forest through the trees, or some such nonsense. Unless its a big part of what it means to be you, you likely don't have to worry about whether you have a spleen, or not. Careful there.
